Q: Can you add options like more dots or different colors?

A: To waste time with beautiful dots and blue things.

Q: I love it. Can I donate?  
A: Please instead donate to EDRI. The members of EDRI (European Digital Rights in Europe) defend civil rights in the information society. http://www.edri.org/about/sponsoring
