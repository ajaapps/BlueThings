Blue Things 
===========

A simple game. Press on a yellow dot. Its neighbours will get blue things. Press again.

Tip: try symmetric press sequences. Enjoy the beauty.

Q: Can you add options like more dots or different colors?  
A: Yes. But I won't, because I like it to be plain and simple.

Q: What's this app good for?  
A: Just to spend some nice time with beautiful dots and things. If you are
asking this question, this app might not be for you.

Q: I love it. Can I donate?  
A: Please instead donate to EDRI. The members of EDRI (European Digital Rights in Europe) defend civil rights in the information society. http://www.edri.org/about/sponsoring
